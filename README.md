## Documentation

Generate PDF files on-the-fly without requiring external extensions.

This module provides a SilverStripe service wrapper around TCPDF, a 
php class for generating PDF documents, see: http://tcpdf.org.

The idea here is to provide pdf generation without the use of third party
libraries. There are other silverstripe pdf modules, but so far they all 
depend on a third party Java app that is executed via a command line call 
to do the actual PDF conversion. 

## Usage Overview

See docs/en for more information about configuring the module.
